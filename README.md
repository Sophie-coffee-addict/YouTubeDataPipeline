# YouTubeDataPipeline
A Python-based ETL pipeline that uses the YouTube Data API to extract and save video comments to a CSV file for further analysis and insights

### Project Background
Maggie has been a YouTuber that I knew for many years and her videos have helped me so much to get to the almost native level of oral English. <br>Recently, I've been diving into Python, had a good, fun reading of Head First Python, and thought I'd play around with Python and real-life data. Turns out, it feels so much fun and great to generate insights from data for future improvement. 
<br>Next up, I'll email the insights generated to Maggie and hopefully it would be helpful to her : )
<br>This project is also inspired by my friend Meiqiao : )

### Key Learnings from This Project
1. **API Integration**: Gained hands-on experience extracting data from YouTube's API, handling pagination, and managing API responses.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Used NLTK's Vader lexicon to perform sentiment analysis on YouTube comments, identifying trends in audience sentiment.
3. **Data Visualization**: Created visual representations of sentiment distribution using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`, making insights more accessible.
4. **Debugging and Problem-Solving**: Resolved key issues like missing data fields (`snippet` errors) and SSL certificate verification errors during API interactions.
5. **Automation**: Automated the process of saving YouTube comments and sentiment scores to CSV files for further analysis.


### Value Created:
- **Audience Insights**: Generated insights into audience sentiment by analyzing YouTube comments, providing creators with actionable feedback.
- **Sentiment Tracking**: Enabled continuous tracking of comment sentiment, helping creators understand how their audience reacts to specific content.
- **Efficient Feedback Pipeline**: Automated the extraction and analysis of user comments, allowing for faster feedback loops and potential content improvement.
